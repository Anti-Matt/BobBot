Bob Hawke College – Senior School Assessment Policy
(ATAR, General, Foundation, Preliminary Courses of Study, Vocational Education and Training and Endorsed Programs).
This policy is provided to all senior secondary students at Bob Hawke College and is based on the School Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA) requirements as outlined in the WACE Manual. See: http://www.scsa.wa.edu.au/internet/Publications/WACE_Manual
All Year 11 and Year 12 students are enrolled in a combination of ATAR, General, Foundation, Preliminary and VET industry specific courses. Some students are also gaining unit equivalence for the Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) by undertaking one of the Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualifications and/or one or more of the endorsed programs which are available at the College. The VET qualifications are delivered and assessed in partnership with a registered training organisation (RTO). This policy applies to the assessment of all WACE courses.
Guiding Principles:
The primary purpose of assessment is to contribute to the ongoing learning of our students.
At Bob Hawke College our assessment policy is shaped by the following principles.
• Assessment should be an integral part of teaching and learning
• Assessment should be educative
• Assessment should be fair
• Assessment should be designed to meet their specific purposes
• Assessment should lead to informative reporting
• Assessment should lead to school-wide evaluation purposes
In the context of Bob Hawke College, this means:
• Successful, ongoing learning is best facilitated when assessments have clearly stated expected outcomes and students receive constructive feedback that contributes to learning.
• Assessments should arise naturally out of the teaching and intended learning of the curriculum and enhance mastery.
• Students, where appropriate, have an agency in the assessment process. With support, students can learn to assess and evaluate their own performance in a way that further extends their learning.
• Assessments need to be fair, equitable and flexible enough to consider the diverse needs of all students at the college.
• Assessment processes should be transparent and accessible to all students, parents and carers.
The following policy has been developed so that students, parents and staff are aware of their responsibilities within this policy and the procedures it outlines. This policy is informed by the teaching and learning culture at Bob Hawke College and has been developed in accordance with regulations set by the SCSA.
Assessment is a critically important aspect of the senior years of schooling. All students, parents and teachers should make themselves aware of their responsibilities within this policy and the procedures it outlines.
The College sets course success criteria for Year 11 and 12 courses. These success criteria are based on previous students’ performance, giving a good indication of the likelihood of success in a particular course. Students should consider these criteria in their decision making to optimise their success.
Framework:
Bob Hawke College administers curriculum, assessment, and reporting in alignment with SCSA. Teachers apply the principles of assessment as required by the Department of Education Assessment Policy determined by SCSA and by standards of fairness and equity for all students.
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024

Students will have access to the following information for all courses of study through COMPASS by Week 1 of each term/ and or semester.
1. A copy of the accredited Authority syllabus (SCSA Courses) which includes the grade descriptions or qualification outline (VET qualifications).
2. A copy of the college assessment policy, which details the procedures used for assessment and grading, and details of how they may appeal against the college assessment.
3. The assessment outline for the course or qualification.
4. Assessment requirements for each qualification
Modification of the Assessment Task Outline
• If the circumstances change during the duration of the course the teacher may need to adjust or amend the assessment outline and this will be communicated to the student and families via Compass.
• Students may have adjusted learning goals and assessment tasks outlined in their Inclusion Plan resulting in their assessment outline being adjusted appropriately.
• When a students personal circumstances limit their ability to complete a particular assessment the teacher in consultation with the students may negotiate a variation in the submission date. The teachers will consider fairness for all students when making decisions regarding adjusting timelines.
Student Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the student to:
• Complete all course/qualification requirements by the due date.
• Support the teacher to maintain, files of assessed work for each course/qualification studied in case if required by the SCSA;
• Maintain a good record of behaviour and attendance (a student who is absent from a class for five lessons or more per term is deemed to be ‘at risk’ of not achieving their full potential);
• Initiate contact with teachers concerning absence from class, missed in-class assessment tasks, requests for extension before the due date for out-of-class assessment tasks and other matters relating to assessment; and
• Be responsible for your personal progress.
• Always participate in learning and assessment in a way that supports teachers and other students
• uphold the values of fairness and integrity by avoiding any actions that could provide an unjust advantage in relation to submitted work or engaging in dishonest practices that may aid others in gaining an unfair advantage.
• Always submit your own work and/or adequately reference work taken from other sources, including AI
Staff Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of staff to:
• Develop a teaching/learning program that adheres to current SCSA guidelines
• Provide students with a course outline and assessment outline at the start of the course. A copy of the course outline and assessment outline will be placed on Compass under class Resources

Feedback:
• Feedback will be provided to the student through various forms appropriate to the task and shared through COMPASS or TEAMs and class/lesson OneNote.
• Feedback may include comments, annotations, rubrics, teacher /student conferencing, scores, and grades. Parents and carers can access COMPASS to monitor their child’s progress and achievement.
• Parents/carers and students will receive regular feedback throughout the year and a formal semester report via COMPASS.
• Students and parents/ carers will be informed when it is identified that there is a risk of the student not:
o Achieving their potential
o Completing the course requirements
o Meeting WACE requirements
School-based Assessment of Student Achievement
Details about College-based assessment practices in Year 11 and Year 12 are provided in Section 2 of the WACE Manual .
At Bob Hawke College we aim for students to be striving for their best academic achievement.
Missed Assessment Work
ATAR/General/Qualifications If a student is absent from class, their ability to achieve to their potential is diminished. Extended absence frequently results in lower levels of achievement, or unit assessment requirements not being met. Students are given every opportunity to meet the requirements of courses and qualifications, but this is only effective if the student attends regularly and punctually.
Practical Assessments
Where scheduled practical assessments are given on set dates as outlined in the assessment program, students are expected to attend. The same penalties apply as outlined in Scheduled In-Class Assessments. It is important students understand that in practical assessments e.g. food assessments, materials for assessment are available on the day only, and students in some cases will be expected to provide their own materials if the assessment is able to be rescheduled.
Group Work
Students working in a group will be assessed individually as detailed in the assessment task.
Scheduled in-class assessments
Absence from a specially scheduled assessment task (including tests, investigations, validations, oral presentations, examinations or practical assessments) must be explained by one of the following:
• Ill health or injury supported by medical certificate. • A major family upset, confirmed by a written statement from a responsible adult. • An unforeseen or unavoidable situation. The College (HOLA) will decide if the reason is acceptable. • Transfer between schools during the school year. • Officially sanctioned activity or excursion. • Wherever possible, advance notification is required via email to the classroom teacher.
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024
Page 5 of 11
ATAR/General Courses
• Students will be expected to complete the assessment item on the day of their return, unless a negotiated alternative arrangement is made with the classroom teacher. If a satisfactory explanation of the absence is accepted, then the student may be able to complete that assessment task or a similar task and gain credit (e.g. if appropriate supervision is guaranteed, permission may be negotiated to complete that task at an alternate venue). • Where no satisfactory explanation of an absence from a scheduled assessment task is received, or alternative arrangements cannot be made, a zero mark is recorded. The decision is to be ratified by the Head of the Learning Area. • NOTE: If a student is LATE for a scheduled assessment item, e.g. test, he/she will be admitted to the TEST room and will be permitted to complete as much work as possible within the remaining scheduled time. The result achieved will be the result recorded.
Qualifications • Assessment outlines clearly indicate when units of competency (UoC) are due and assessed. Completion of scheduled assessments in the Assessment outline must be adhered to the appropriate deadlines. • Where a satisfactory explanation of an absence during a missed assessment is provided the trainer will provide for the assessment to be completed during the next scheduled class unless the assessment was a practical activity. • Where the explanation provided is not satisfactory the student must renegotiate an extension with the trainer. If this is the second renegotiation to attain the competency, then the student’s extension may be denied.
• Students may attempt assessment tasks more than once if competence is not met in the first instance.
• Practical assessments cannot always be rescheduled due to specialist facilities and provider availability, resourcing and timing. It is essential that students complete these assessments on the dates provided. Where possible the trainer will try and organise for this missed assessment to be completed but only for students who had a valid reason for missing the original assessment.
• Students must provide evidence to demonstrate the competency standard of every unit of competence in their qualification. If the student is unsuccessful, they will be deemed not yet competent in that unit and will be awarded a partial qualification. A Statement of Attainment will be issued by the RTO. Partial qualifications may not provide WACE credit.
Prolonged Absence ATAR/General Courses
• Where a student is unable to attend college for a lengthy period due to injury or illness, a case conference with the Program Coordinator - Senior School and other support staff will be held. To complete a course unit, students need to have been provided with the opportunity to complete the College structured educational program and assessment program. If a student has an ongoing illness or acceptable reason for an extended absence, supported by appropriate documentation, the College will alter the assessment outline for the individual, while still ensuring that enough assessment is available to be awarded a grade.
If a student is absent from the college for an extended period of time, regardless of the reason, it may not be possible in the time remaining to complete sufficient assessments to be awarded a grade. In this case, the College will meet with the student and identify that this is the case.
Qualifications
Where a student is unable to attend the College for a lengthy period due to injury or illness, a case conference will be held with the Program Coordinator.
To achieve the full qualification students must complete all assessment requirements of the training and assessment strategy under the direction of the trainer/assessor. A plan will be discussed to support the student where possible to meet these requirements.
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024

Non-submission of out of class assessment
ATAR/General
A course overview, including timelines for submission of assessment task, will be provided to each student at the start of the course. Due dates will be clearly outlined and implemented. Where adjustment to a deadline is necessary, it will be made in close consultation with students and publicised.
It is the teacher’s responsibility to manage the assessment outline, and the student’s responsibility to provide evidence of achievement by the published timelines.
Year 11 and 12 General and ATAR Courses
Late penalties are applied to ensure equity in student assessment and encourage students to submit work by specified deadlines.
Students experiencing difficulty meeting deadlines for acceptable reasons should in the first instance negotiate with their classroom teacher for an extension and support. Penalties are only applied to those students who have not successfully negotiated an alternative due date PRIOR to a task being due. Teachers will email parents notification of negotiated assessment deadlines.
Failure to submit assessed work on time, without a negotiated extension will result in a late penalty. 5% of the total marks available for the task will be deducted from the mark achieved by the student for each day the task is late for the first 4 days. Once a task is 5 days’ late students in: a) ATAR classes will receive a mark of 0, and should be encouraged to complete the task for feedback purposes b) General courses will receive a MAXIMUM mark of 50% regardless of the mark achieved.
Days Late % of Marks available to be deducted 1 5 2 10 3 15 4 20
Example 1: A student achieves 51 out of 60 for a tasks, the task was submitted 3 days late: The student has 0.15 x 60 = 9 Marks deducted from the 51 achieved so receives a final mark of 42 out of 60.
Example 2: A student in a General course hands in the same task and achieved the same mark, however the task is 5 days late. The student will be received 30 out of 60. *If a student in a General course achieves above 50% and the late penalty results in a mark below 50%, a mark of 50% will be awarded.
When recorded marks for tasks that have had a late penalty applied in reporting to parents the teacher should make a note of the actual mark achieved within the notes section for that task.
Acceptable reasons: • Ill health or injury supported by a certificate from a medical practitioner, or the school nurse. • A major family upset – confirmed by a written statement from a responsible adult. • Transfers between schools during a course. • An unforeseen or unavoidable situation. The teacher, in consultation with the HOLA may decide if the reason is acceptable. • Considerations outlined in the students inclusion plan
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024
Page 7 of 11
In extreme cases, if a student continues to miss re-negotiated deadlines for an assessment item, a mark of zero may be recorded for that assessment item. This decision is to be ratified by the Head of the Learning Area.
Families are discouraged from taking students on holidays during term time. Parents need to notify the school at least 4 weeks in advance and the student must negotiate the completion of assessments with the teachers. This may mean that assessments scheduled during the period the student is away, have to be completed before the student commences the holiday. Parents must also realise that the student may receive lower than expected marks due to missing course work.
Qualifications
In class and out of class activities provides students with the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge to meet the competency standard of the units. It is therefore essential that students complete these activities before undertaking assessments. Completion of these activities will contribute towards the student’s portfolio of evidence.
Changing Course
Transfer between courses and/or units
Generally, it is not possible to change after the advertised last date for course changes, as to do so would place a student at risk of not completing requirements. The college will only consider changes in exceptional circumstances based on induvial case management
At Bob Hawke College, the deadline for student transfers in Years 11 and 12 is Week 6 in Term 1. A student transferring by the due date will be withdrawn from the original pair of units and no grade will be assigned.
In Year 11, students can also transfer at the end of Semester 1, where class numbers enable this to occur. In such cases, the student will receive a mark and a grade for the unit completed in Semester 1.
Year 11 students studying a Foundation course will be required to transfer to a General and/or ATAR course for Semester 2, if they meet the literacy and/or numeracy standards in the March round of the Online Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (OLNA), as per instructions in SCSA’s WACE Manual.
Transfer from another school
Where a student changes school during a school year, credit for the completion of work in the same course will be given when the student and/or previous school supplies appropriate evidence of all completed assessment tasks from the previous school. prior to SCSA’s recommended last date for student transfers between pairs of Year 11 units. This information will be used by the College to determine what additional content and assessment tasks the student needs to complete to be assigned a mark and a grade in the pair of units for the course.
If a Year 11 student transfers from another school into the same course, and it is mid-year, the previous school should provide a grade and mark for the unit to SCSA. The student would then be enrolled in a single unit for Semester 2. Where a transferring student is being enrolled in a course they did not study at their previous school, the student will be enrolled in a single unit for Semester 2.
If a student transfers from another school in Year 12, they may only be enrolled in Year 12 courses if the transfer occurs prior to SCSA’s Year 12 course enrolment deadline (usually the first week of April). After that date, Year 12 students will not be permitted to enrol in Year 12 courses.
A meeting will be held with the student and parent/guardian to discuss the student’s progress and the requirements necessary for the student to be assigned a grade in the pair of units into which they wish to transfer.
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024

Cheating, Collusion and Plagiarism:
Section 2 of the WACE Manual - 2.6 Use of non-original material for assessment purposes requires that the teacher is able to verify that a student’s work is in fact their own. The teacher may refuse to use some work as evidence for assessment if he/she is not completely satisfied that it is the student’s work.
Students who have deliberately or intentionally cheated on or plagiarised assessed work will receive a score of ‘0’. If a student submits work that is not his or her own for assessment, he or she will receive no marks for the copied work.
Further, any student found to be involved in cheating, plagiarism or collusion is at risk of loss of privilege and/or other consequences. In all cases where cheating, collusion or plagiarism has occurred, the parent/carer will be notified by the teacher and the student will have the right to appeal.
The use of unapproved websites/ mobile device and incorrect calculators during an assessment, may also be deemed cheating.
Academic misconduct refers to conduct of a student that is dishonest or unfair with regards to work submitted as part of an assessment. Academic misconduct may provide an advantage to the student responsible for the misconduct or to other students.
Students are not permitted to submit for marking/rating, as original, any work that is:
• identical or similar material to the work of another person (e.g. another student, a parent, a tutor, or teacher);
• identical, or similar material to a published work unless the source is acknowledged in referencing or footnotes; or
• identical or similar to their own previously submitted work.
Students should not behave in a way that provides an advantage to other students. Any sharing of assessment information such as assessment questions, concepts assessed or not assessed is called collusion (whether intended or not) and provides some students with an unfair advantage.
Some examples of collusion include (but are not limited to):
• informal conversations about the assessment before all students have completed the assessment. • written notes, handed to other students. • text messages with assessment information shared with others; and • any sharing of assessment information on social media.
In the case of group-tasks or take-home assessments, classroom teachers will provide guidelines regarding responsibilities of group members to ensure the integrity of the assessment.
Students may need to complete a cover sheet/declaration for major assignments, which is to be signed and submitted with completed tasks.
If it is demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a student has plagiarised or cheated the following penalties will apply: • a mark of zero for the whole assessment task, or • a mark of zero for part of the assessment where the teacher can identify the part of the assessment task that has been copied or plagiarised.
If it demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a student has provided an unfair advantage to another student through collusion, then penalties will be applied to all students involved.
Any use of generative AI in student assessment (text, code, audio and visual generators) must be referenced as specified by the course eg. APA Referencing

Security of assessment tasks
Where there is more than one class studying the same pair of units at the College, all the assessment tasks will be the same to ensure student marks are on the same scale. In cases where there is more than one class, to ensure that no students are unfairly advantaged, the question papers used for in-class assessment tasks will be collected at the end of the lesson and retained by the teacher until the task has been completed by all classes. In their own interests, students must not discuss the nature of the questions with students from the other classes until after all classes have completed the task. Discussion of the questions will be treated as collusion and the students will be penalised.
Where the College works with other schools and uses the same assessment task or examination, the task/examination and the student responses will be retained by the teacher until the task/examination has been completed by all schools.
Students with a disability
Students with a diagnosed disability will, where their disability, impairment or medical condition will significantly affect their access to a particular assessment task, have written and/or practical assessment tasks (including school examinations) adjusted by the teacher in consultation with the relevant head of learning area/teacher-in-charge responsible for the course. These adjustments will be consistent with those described in SCSA’s Disability Adjustment Guidelines, which can be accessed from SCSA website (https://senior-secondary.scsa.wa.edu.au/assessment/disability-adjustment-guidelines). Adjustments, depending on the individual student’s education needs, can include special equipment, modified papers, provision of a scribe, or additional time to complete the task.
Note: for Year 12 students with a diagnosed disability which has functional impact on their performance, the College will apply to SCSA for consideration of special examination arrangements. The granting of special examination arrangements by SCSA is not automatic. Where SCSA approves arrangements for the ATAR course examinations, these arrangements may differ from those the College has used for school-based assessment. Students who have been granted special examination arrangements should be aware that their ATAR course examinations will be held at alternative venues.
Interruption-free and Assessment-free periods
To reduce some of the pressure on students as they prepare for examinations and to allow quality revision time, the one-week period before the examination block will be free of excursions, camps, major productions or other events likely to distract students. The week prior to the exam block is Assessment Free for students. There will be no in-class assessments, practical performances scheduled during these weeks. Assignments are not to be scheduled for submission in these weeks. During this week, students are expected to do exam practice and complete course revision tasks.
School Examinations and Internally /Externally Set Tasks (I/ESTs)
School examinations and I/ESTs will take place for Senior School students in several courses with varying duration.
Examinations and I/ESTs are conducted under strict exam conditions. The College applies the same structure and penalties that are similar to the exam conditions applied by SCSA during WACE exams.
Link from SCSA - Years 11 and 12 | Rules of conduct for Year 12 ATAR course examinations (scsa.wa.edu.au)
The examination schedule will be placed on the school calendar in Compass.
Unless there is an Authorised Absence, students who miss an examination or I/EST shall NOT be permitted to sit the exam/EST at another time and a mark of 0 will be recorded.
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024
Page 10 of 11
Parents/Guardians of a student who cannot attend an examination/EST (or students themselves if they live independently of family) must notify the HOLA by 8.30am on the day of the examination or EST, and must complete a Sickness and Misadventure Form by 3.00pm the day following the scheduled examination/EST. This form can be found on Compass in School Documentation.
The student must submit a Sickness/Misadventure Form to Student Central and the relevant Program Coordinator. The school will determine whether the reason is acceptable. If the reason is acceptable to the school, an alternate date will be set or, where this is not possible, the student will not sit the examination. In this case, a predicted examination score will be allocated based on the student’s performance in other assessments relative to that of the cohort and the performance of the cohort in the examination.
Reporting student achievement
The College reports student achievement at the end of Semester 1 and at the end of Semester 2 to SCSA including:
• a grade[1]
• the percentage mark in the school-based examination (for ATAR courses)
• the percentage mark1 (calculated from the weighted total mark).
At the end of the year, students will be provided with a report which lists the school mark and grade for each pair of units. These are the results which will be submitted to SCSA. Successful completion of VET qualifications and endorsed programs are also listed.
All final grades are subject to approval by SCSA at the end of the year. Students will be notified of any changes from SCSA’s review of the students’ results submitted by the College.
[1] The Semester 1 mark and grade are interim as they are not finalised until the pair of units is completed at the end of the year.
Appeals & Reviewing marks and grades
Students may appeal against their school assessments decisions to determine whether:
• the assessment program conforms to SCSA requirements
• the assessment procedures conform to the assessment policy based on SCSA guidelines
• there are any procedural or computational errors in determining the assessment outcome.
Student appeals against assessment decisions will normally be directed to the classroom teacher and Head of Learning Area, followed by the Associate Principal.
In the case of appeals to SCSA, the school is required to provide the following information to SCSA’s Student Appeal Against School Assessment Committee with:
• a copy of the school's senior secondary assessment policy
• a copy of the school's assessment outline in the subject/course concerned
• a copy of the assessment records for all students studying the subject/course in the school with the appellant’s results indicated
• any other relevant school information as required by the appeals committee.
Qualifications
The Appeal process is outlined in information provided by the respective RTO to students prior to commencing the qualification. This is done via a Student Induction.
In summary, students should in the first instance discuss this with their Trainer. If they are not satisfied with the outcome, then they should arrange a meeting with the Program Coordinator at Bob Hawke College to discuss their issues. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of this meeting they are able to make a complaint to the RTO via their respective appeal documentation and process.
SENIOR ASSESSMENT POLICY - 2024
Page 11 of 11
If the RTO is not able to resolve to the student’s satisfaction, they are able to complain to the Australian Skills Quality Authority or get advice from the National Training Hotline on 133873. This should be a last resort however.
Retention and Disposal of Student Work
The college and students in the Senior Years must keep all marked, returned assessment tasks for review until the grades have been approved by SCSA, at the conclusion of student appeals at the end of March in the following year. All assessment material may be required by the teacher when assigning grades at the completion of the pair of units. SCSA may also request access to the assessment tasks for moderation purposes so students must retain their files until the College’s grades are approved by SCSA, at the conclusion of student appeals at the end of Term 4.
The College will not use the materials for any other purposes without the written permission of the student.
Procedures for Catastrophic Events
Where a catastrophic event (e.g. a pandemic) affects delivery of the learning and teaching program, the completion or submission of one or more assessment tasks, and/or completion of the college examination timetable may need modification. Students will be advised by the school of adjustments to the task requirements and/or the assessment outline.
College Awards and Certificates
During Year 11 and 12 students excellence, student achievement, student progress and student engagement is recognised and acknowledged. Principal’s Awards, Certificates of Excellence and Merit are issued by the School to recognise individual excellence and merit by students. The final decision on the granting of each college award or prize is made by the Principal.
At the end of Year 12 excellence and achievement is recognised at the Bob Hawke College Year 12 Farewell Assembly and Presentation Ceremony attended by all students who complete their secondary schooling. Certificates are awarded for WACE Courses, the WACE ATAR Dux, a VET Dux and special college value and community achievements.
Selection Criteria for School WACE ATAR Dux Award:
• Have satisfied the requirements for the WACE.
• Awarded for excellence to the student who achieves the top scores based on the average of five equated scores in ATAR courses, calculated to two decimal places.
• At least one of the course scores must be from each of List A and List B subjects.
• Scores must be from Year 12 courses
• The final decision is made by the Principal.
Selection Criteria for School VET Dux Award:
• Have satisfied the requirements for the WACE.
• Demonstrated the most outstanding performance in an AQF VET Certificate II or higher.
• Awarded for excellence to the student who achieves the top scores based on the average of three equated scores in General courses, calculated to two decimal places.
• At least one of the General course scores must be from each of List A and List B subjects.
• Other achievements such as special recognition by the workplace employer, an industry or community award.
• The final decision is made by the Principal.
