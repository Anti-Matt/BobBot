Bob Hawke College - 7-10 Assessment Policy
Guiding Principles:
The primary purpose of assessment is to contribute to the ongoing learning of our students.
At Bob Hawke College our assessment policy is shaped by the following principles.
• Assessment should be an integral part of teaching and learning
• Assessment should be educative
• Assessment should be fair
• Assessment should be designed to meet their specific purposes
• Assessment should lead to informative reporting
• Assessment should lead to school-wide evaluation purposes (Principles of Teaching, Learning and Assessment Western Australian Curriculum and Assessment Outline) k10outline - Principles of Teaching, Learning and Assessment (scsa.wa.edu.au)
In the context of Bob Hawke College, this means:
• Successful, ongoing learning is best facilitated when assessments have clearly stated expected outcomes and students receive constructive feedback that contributes to learning.
• Assessments should arise naturally out of the teaching and intended learning of the curriculum and enhance mastery .
• Students, where appropriate, have agency in the assessment process. With support, students can learn to assess and evaluate their own performance in a way that further extends their learning.
• Assessments need to be fair, equitable and flexible enough to consider the diverse needs of all students at the college.
• Assessment processes should be transparent and accessible to all students, parents and carers.
Framework:
Accurate and comprehensive assessment of student progress and achievement is informed by the judging standards of the Western Australian Curriculum - k10outline - Western Australian Curriculum (scsa.wa.edu.au)
Bob Hawke College administers curriculum, assessment, and reporting in alignment with Schools Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA). Teachers apply the principles of assessment as required by the Department of Education Assessment Policy determined by SCSA and by standards of fairness and equity for all students.
Year 7 – 10 students will have access to the following information for all courses of study through COMPASS by Week 1 of each term/ and or semester.
1. Course outline; the curriculum of study throughout the semester
2. Assessment outline; including task outlines, weightings for tasks, intended dates for assessments for the semester
Types of Assessments:
There are many ways to determine a student’s learning and progress. Three types of assessment are generally used for this purpose; diagnostic, formative and summative.
• Diagnostic assessment informs benchmark or baseline knowledge and understanding.
• Formative assessment informs the teaching and learning program and is an ongoing process of formal and informal assessment and feedback.
• Summative assessment is used to make a 'final' determination of student achievement. It usually comes at the end of teaching and learning cycle. Some examples of summative assessments may include a test, quiz, assignment, project, essay, exam, or task.
Modification of the Assessment Task Outline
• If the circumstances change during the duration of the course the teacher may need to adjust or amend the assessment outline and this will be communicated to the student and families via Compass.
• Student may have adjusted learning goals and assessment tasks outlined in their Inclusion Plan resulting in their assessment outline being adjusted appropriately.
• When a students personal circumstances limit their ability to complete a particular assessment the teacher in consultation with the students may negotiate a variation in the submission date. The teachers will consider fairness for all students when making decisions regarding adjusting timelines. Responsibilities All members of the College community have a responsibility to contribute towards student achievement and success.
Student Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the student to:
• Complete all set tasks by the due date;
• Support the teacher to maintain, files of assessed work in case if required by the School Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA);
• Maintain a good record of behaviour and attendance (a student who is absent from a class for five lessons or more per term is deemed to be ‘at risk’ of not achieving their full potential);
• Advise teachers concerning absence from class, missed in-class assessment tasks, requests for extension before the due date for out-of-class assessment tasks and other matters relating to assessment; and
• Complete classwork, homework and revision tasks which may or may not be formally assessed but are essential to the teaching and learning program.
Teacher responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the teacher to:
• Develop a teaching/learning program that meets the syllabus requirements;
• Provide students (electronically/hard copy) with a course outline and an assessment outline at the start of the course. The course outline will include a summary of topics, skills to be developed, links to the next body of work. The assessment outline will include information about type and timing of the assessment and its weighting. If any amendments need to be made to this information, the teacher will ensure all students are advised and ensure that assessments are fair, valid and reliable;
• Use a range of assessment types when assessing student learning (marks from tests, observations, digital recordings of student performance, portfolios, anecdotal evidence etc);
• Make provision for students who miss an assessment for valid reasons;
• Encourage students to always complete work to the best of their ability and advise them of the consequences of cheating, plagiarism and collusion;
• Maintain files of assessed work in case required by SCSA(more appropriate for Year 10-12);
• Provide students with timely assessment feedback and guidance(within two weeks of the completion of an assessment);
• Advise parents/carers via COMPASS where a student has completed work that deserves commendation and if a student’s performance is lower than expected;
• Provide information to parents/carers on how a student’s achievement compares with the student’s peer group, on request from the parent/carer;
• Use achievement information when planning programs;
• Maintain accurate records of student achievement;
• Meet school and external timelines for assessment and reporting (see below);
• Administer national and state-wide assessments and use the data to inform their judgements about student achievements;
• Adjust assessment conditions for students with identified academic and social-emotional challenges and disabilitiy; and
• Engage in regular professional learning and make use of support materials including Judging Standards (achievement standards, assessment pointers and annotated work samples) to make valid and reliable judgements when determining whether students can demonstrate their knowledge, understanding and skills in relation to the year level achievement standard. Parent/Carer responsibilities It is the responsibility of the parent/carer to: • Provide information to the College on enrolment about their student’s individual needs including academic and social-emotional challenges and disabilitiy. .. • Contact the teacher in the first instance (then the specific Head of Learning Area if there are concerns about student engagement and achievement in a specific course; • contact Student Central and the Inclusion team if there is a general academic, social=- emotional issue that emerges after enrolment. • Communicate with teachers and attend parent nights and conferences when appropriate • Provide evidence for absence when their child is absent from an assessment or test. eg. Medical Certificate.
Feedback:
Feedback will be provided to the student through various forms appropriate to the task and shared through COMPASS or TEAMs and class/lesson OneNote.
Feedback may include comments, annotations, rubrics, teacher /student conferencing, scores, and grades. Parents and carers can access COMPASS to monitor their child’s progress and achievement.
Parents/carers and students will receive progress report throughout the year and a formal semester report via COMPASS.
Achievement Levels:
Teachers make determination of achievement levels through their professional knowledge of the standards of achievement and the judging standards. Information about the standards of achievement and Judging Standards is available through the SCSA website -k10outline - Western Australian Curriculum (scsa.wa.edu.au)
The expected standard for each year group curriculum is described as 'C' or Satisfactory and at Bob Hawke College we aim for students to be striving for their best academic achievement.
Authorised Absence:
ABSENCE FROM IN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS and EXAMS
Authorised absences include those due to sickness, educational activities, excursions, cultural activities and other extenuating circumstances approved by the College on a case-by-case basis. A student who has an authorised absence on the day an assessment is scheduled, or an assignment is due, will not be penalised, however, they must sit the assessment or submit the assignment, at the earliest convenience upon returning from absence.
All assessments must be completed by the student within five working days of the original assessment date. When this is not possible due to authorised absences or other legitimate extenuating circumstances, students may have no mark recorded for the missed task, at the discretion of the classroom teacher and Head of Learning Area. This will not impact the student’s overall mark for the course.
A medical certificate or communication explaining the reason for the student’s absence, from his/her parent/caregiver must be submitted to the student’s teacher upon return to school. See below for more information.
The penalty for non-completion of an in-class assessment task will be waived if the student provides a reason for the absence which is acceptable to the college. For example:
• where sickness or injury prevents a student attending
• where significant personal circumstances i.e. funeral or accident prevents a student attending
• where a specialist medical appointment prevents a student attending.
Where possible advanced notification of a student absence from an in-class assessment is required.
Absence from an in-class assessment task must be communicated to the classroom teacher by the parent/carer using one of the following:
• letter from parents/carer
• email from parents/caregivers.
In this communication parents/caregivers are required to:
• provide a reason for their child’s absence
• acknowledge that they are aware that their child has been absent for an in -class assessment.
Satisfactory explanation of the absence will be approved by the classroom teacher (in conjunction with the HOLA where necessary) and a record kept by the classroom teacher.
Where the student provides a reason, which is acceptable to the college for the non-completion of an invigilated task, the teacher will:
• negotiate an adjusted due date for an in-class assessment task. As a general rule students sit the task during the next scheduled teaching period OR
• decide on an alternate assessment task (if, in the opinion of the teacher, the assessment is no longer confidential) OR
• no longer require the task to be completed, provided the teacher has sufficient evidence from other tasks completed to enable a grade and mark to be assigned.
Please note: in situations whereby the parent/guardian has phoned in an absence to Student Central and this is approved and recorded on Compass the classroom teacher, upon realising the student is absent from an in class assessment, must notify the parent/guardian via email and ascertain the situation following the three dot points above.
If this becomes a trend for this student, then HOLA intervention and Student Central support may be required. Satisfactory explanation of the absence will be approved by the classroom teacher (in conjunction with the HOLA where necessary) and a record kept by the classroom teacher.
Where the situation is deemed not acceptable a score of zero is recorded and parent/carer is contacted by email.
Unauthorised Absence:
If a student does not submit or complete an assessment due to absences that are not authorised by the college, the student may be issued a ‘0’ mark. See below for more information.
Non-Submission/Non-Completion:
For assessment tasks submitted after the due date or not submitted, where the student does not provide a reason that is approved by the College, the task may be issued a ‘0’ mark.
Unapproved absence for in-class assessment and Exams
A penalty for non-completion of an in-class assessment task will be activated when no reason for the absence has been given or the reason provided is unacceptable to the college.
Events that can be rescheduled are not a valid reason for non-completion of an in-class assessment task. These include:
• family holidays
• general medical appointments that could be scheduled outside of college hours
• preparations for social functions
• external activities that are not part of the college’s curriculum
Note: Any student who misses an assessment after leaving the College due to illness: without following correct procedures the college (working through Student Central and/or referral from college nurse) will not be provided with a valid reason by Student Central.
Penalty: If a valid reason is not provided, the assessment schedule will not be modified and the student will be awarded a “zero” mark for the missed assessment.
Use of Technology:
Technology failure (including low battery or forgetting to bring a device) during in-class assessments using student devices is not considered an acceptable reason for non-submission of assessments. Teacher and/or HOLA discretion may be used for other technology failures although the onus is always on the student to have charged, functioning devices and logins.
Students must take responsibility to ensure they save and upload documents appropriately
Extension:
A student may be granted an extension to the due date in extenuating circumstances, as determined by the teacher and Head of Learning Area on a case-by-case basis. An extension request can be found on Compass and be emailed to the classroom teacher at least one day before the due date.
Cheating, Collusion and Plagiarism:
The School Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA) policy requires that the teacher is able to verify that a student’s work is in fact their own. The teacher may refuse to use some work as evidence for assessment if he/she is not completely satisfied that it is the student’s work.
Students who have deliberately or intentionally cheated on or plagiarised assessed work will receive a score of ‘0’. If a student submits work that is not his or her own for assessment, he or she will receive no marks for the copied work.
Further, any student found to be involved in cheating, plagiarism or collusion is at risk of loss of privilege and/or other consequences. In all cases where cheating, collusion or plagiarism has occurred, the parent/carer will be notified by the teacher and the student will have the right to appeal.
The use of unapproved websites/ mobile device and incorrect calculators during an assessment, may also be deemed cheating.
Academic misconduct refers to conduct of a student that is dishonest or unfair with regards to work submitted as part of an assessment. Academic misconduct may provide an advantage to the student responsible for the misconduct or to other students.
Students are not permitted to submit for marking/rating, as original, any work that is:
• identical or similar material to the work of another person (e.g. another student, a parent, a tutor, or teacher);
• identical, or similar material to a published work unless the source is acknowledged in referencing or footnotes; or
• identical or similar to their own previously submitted work.
Students should not behave in a way that provides an advantage to other students. Any sharing of assessment information such as assessment questions, concepts assessed or not assessed is called collusion (whether intended or not) and provides some students with an unfair advantage.
Some examples of collusion include (but are not limited to): • informal conversations about the assessment before all students have completed the assessment. • written notes, handed to other students. • text messages with assessment information shared with others; and • any sharing of assessment information on social media.
In the case of group-tasks or take-home assessments, classroom teachers will provide guidelines regarding responsibilities of group members to ensure the integrity of the assessment.
Students may need to complete a cover sheet/declaration for major assignments, which is to be signed and submitted with completed tasks.
If it is demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a student has plagiarised or cheated the following penalties will apply: • a mark of zero for the whole assessment task, or • a mark of zero for part of the assessment where the teacher can identify the part of the assessment task that has been copied or plagiarised.
If it demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that a student has provided an unfair advantage to another student through collusion, then penalties will be applied to all students involved. Students who compromise the validity of an assessment by sharing specific details will be addressed, parents contacted and a College sanction enforced. This may also result in a revised assessment having to be re-sat by all students affected.
Security of assessment tasks
Where there is more than one class studying the same pair of units at the College, all the assessment tasks will be the same to ensure student marks are on the same scale. In cases where there is more than one class, to ensure that no students are unfairly advantaged, the question papers used for in-class assessment tasks will be collected at the end of the lesson and retained by the teacher until the task has been completed by all classes. In their own interests, students must not discuss the nature of the questions with students from the other classes until after all classes have completed the task. Discussion of the questions will be treated as collusion and the students will be penalised.
Plagiarism and use of Generative AI
A teacher may refuse to use some work as evidence for assessment if they are not satisfied it is the student’s work.
Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the use of machine learning models to generate text, code, audio or visual texts in response to user prompts.
Any use of generative AI in student assessment (text, code, audio and visual generators) must be referenced as specified by the course eg. APA Referencing

Note: The use of ChatGPT is restricted to 18+ years of age and is blocked on the Department’s network.
Late submissions:
A student who does not submit a take-home assessment on the due date will attract the penalty of either:
1. lunch and/or recess detention run by class teacher or HOLA until the assessment is submitted or five school days have passed.
2. deduct marks in line with length of time overdue (20% per day)
Special Arrangements and Modification to Assessments
In accordance with Department of Education policy, students with disability, impairment or diagnosed medical conditions may be eligible for adjustments to timed assessments (i.e. exams and tests). These adjustments must be arranged prior to the assessment, in consultation with the College. Where a known disability, impairment or diagnosed medical condition requires adjustment, teachers will be informed about the appropriate level of adjustment by SCSA Disability Adjustment Guidelines, and relevant legislation.
Interruption-free and Assessment-free periods
To reduce some of the pressure on students as they prepare for examinations and to allow quality revision time, the one-week period before the examination block will be free of excursions, camps, major productions or other events likely to distract students. The week prior to the exam block is Assessment Free for students. There will be no in-class assessments, practical performances scheduled during these weeks. Assignments are not to be scheduled for submission in these weeks. During this week, students are expected to do exam practice and complete course revision tasks.
Examinations
School examinations will take place for Year 10 students in several course with varying duration.
Examinations are conducted under strict exam conditions which will provide the training and guidelines for success in Year 11 and 12. The College applies the same structure and penalties that are similar to the exam conditions applied by the Authority during WACE exams.
Link from SCSA - Years 11 and 12 | Rules of conduct for Year 12 ATAR course examinations (scsa.wa.edu.au)
The examination schedule will be placed on the school calendar in Compass.
Unless there is an Authorised Absence, students who miss an examination shall NOT be permitted to sit the exam at another time and a mark of 0 will be recorded.
Parents/Guardians of a student who cannot attend an examination (or students themselves if they live independently of family) must notify the HOLA by 8.30am on the day of the examination, and must complete a Sickness and Misadventure Form by 3.00pm the day following the scheduled examination. This form can be found on Compass in School Documentation.
The College staff will be working with each individual student to support them through their first cycle of exams. Within each learning area and in CREW staff will be provide study skills, stress management tips and support for them to achieve their best. Our Inclusion Team will work closely with individual students who may need adjustments or supports as part of their inclusion plan to complete the exams as appropriate to their learning goals.
